Our *~~Tamagotchi~~* **Fabagotchi** is an homage to the simple days of 90s browser games, gameboys, Pok√©mon and such awesome things.

It is a chance for us to work on a joint project that isn't a marked requirment under a strict time frame, so we can prepare ourselves for a project based future.

And a chance to build something totally fun!

# Concept

The Fabagotchi is a web based digital pet that you Adopt from the Fabagotchi Pound.

Once you see an egg you like, you adopt it and care for it through the various stages of its lifecycle.

But beware, if you dont look after it it'll die!
